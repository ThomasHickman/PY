With more\n sophisticated tools (like HaplotypeCaller) that involve reconstructing haplotypes (eg through reassembly), the problem\n of multiple valid representations is handled internally and does not need to be corrected explicitly.</p>\n\n <h3>Input</h3>\n <p>\n A bam file with mapped reads.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Output</h3>\n <p>\n A bam file in which indels have been left-aligned where appropriate.\n </p>\n\n <h3>Usage example</h3>\n <pre>\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   -T LeftAlignIndels \\\n   -I reads.bam \\\n   -o output_with_leftaligned_indels.bam\n </pre>",
